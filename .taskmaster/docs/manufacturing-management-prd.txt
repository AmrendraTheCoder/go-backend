# Overview  
The In-House Manufacturing Operations Management System is a real-time, multi-interface platform designed specifically for internal manufacturing operations. This system digitalizes and streamlines job creation, inventory management, and production tracking across machine stations, stock areas, and administrative oversight. The platform eliminates paper-based workflows and manual tracking systems by providing seamless real-time communication between internal staff including operators, machine technicians, stock managers, and administrators through dedicated tablet and web interfaces optimized for their specific roles.

The system solves the critical operational problem of disconnected manual processes, lost paperwork, delayed updates, and lack of real-time visibility into job status and inventory levels. By creating a unified digital ecosystem where job updates, stock levels, and machine status flow instantly across all workstations, the platform reduces operational delays, eliminates manual errors, enables data-driven decision making, and significantly improves production efficiency and resource utilization.
