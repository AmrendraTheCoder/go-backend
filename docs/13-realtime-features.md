# Real-time Features

## Live Updates and Notifications

This document explains how the Ganpathi Overseas Manufacturing System provides instant updates and real-time communication across all devices and users.

## What "Real-Time" Means

Think of real-time updates like a live sports broadcast:

- **Events happen** on the production floor (like scoring a goal)
- **Information travels instantly** to all connected devices (like TV viewers)
- **Everyone sees updates** at the same time without waiting
- **No delay** between action and notification

## How Real-Time Works

### The Technology Behind It

**WebSocket Connections**:
