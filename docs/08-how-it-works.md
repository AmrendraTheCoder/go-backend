# How It Works

## Simple Explanation of System Architecture

This document explains how the Ganpathi Overseas Manufacturing System works behind the scenes, written in simple terms that anyone can understand.

## Think of It Like a Restaurant

Imagine the printing business like a busy restaurant:

- **Customers** place orders (print jobs)
- **Waiters** (coordinators) take orders and manage tables
- **Kitchen** (production floor) prepares the food (prints)
- **Inventory** (stock room) stores ingredients (paper and supplies)
- **Manager** (admin) oversees everything and handles money

Our system helps all these parts work together smoothly!

## The Main Parts of the System

### 1. The Database (Like a Filing Cabinet)

**What it stores**:
- Customer information and order history
- Job details and specifications
- Inventory levels and supplier data
- Machine status and maintenance records
- User accounts and permissions

**Think of it as**: A huge digital filing cabinet that never loses papers and can find any information instantly.

### 2. The Server (Like the Restaurant Manager)

**What it does**:
- Receives requests from users
- Checks if users are allowed to do what they're asking
- Gets information from the database
- Sends responses back to users
- Keeps everything organized and secure

**Think of it as**: The restaurant manager who coordinates between customers, waiters, and kitchen staff.

### 3. The Web Interface (Like the Menu and Order System)

**What users see**:
- Login screens to identify who you are
- Dashboards showing current status
- Forms to enter new information
- Lists of jobs, customers, and inventory
- Reports and charts

**Think of it as**: The restaurant's menu, ordering system, and status board all in one.

## How Information Flows

### When Someone Logs In

1. **User enters** username and password
2. **System checks** if credentials are correct
3. **System creates** a security token (like a temporary ID badge)
4. **User gets access** to appropriate features based on their role

**Like**: Showing your employee ID to get into the restaurant kitchen.

### When Creating a New Job

1. **Coordinator enters** job details on their screen
2. **Information travels** to the server
3. **Server saves** job information in the database
4. **Server checks** if materials are available
5. **System updates** dashboards for everyone to see
6. **Notifications sent** to relevant people

**Like**: Waiter takes order, tells kitchen, checks ingredients, updates order board.

### When Tracking Job Progress

1. **Operator updates** job status on tablet
2. **Change recorded** in database instantly
3. **Real-time updates** sent to all connected users
4. **Dashboards refresh** automatically
5. **Notifications sent** to customer and coordinator

**Like**: Kitchen staff updates order status, and the customer automatically sees their order is ready.

## Real-Time Communication

### What "Real-Time" Means

**Real-time** means information updates instantly across all devices, like:
- Job status changes appear immediately on all screens
- Inventory alerts show up as soon as stock runs low
- Machine problems notify supervisors instantly

**Think of it as**: Everyone in the restaurant having walkie-talkies so they can communicate instantly.

### How It Works Technically

1. **WebSocket connections** keep browsers connected to the server
2. **When something changes**, server immediately tells all connected users
3. **Browsers update** their displays without needing to refresh
4. **Users see changes** within seconds of them happening

## Security and Access Control

### User Roles (Like Different Job Positions)

**Admin** (Restaurant Owner):
- Can see and do everything
- Manages other users
- Views all financial information
- Controls system settings

**Manager** (Restaurant Manager):
- Oversees daily operations
- Approves large jobs
- Views performance reports
- Manages customer relationships

**Coordinator** (Head Waiter):
- Creates and manages jobs
- Communicates with customers
- Schedules production
- Tracks order progress

**Machine Operator** (Kitchen Staff):
- Updates job progress
- Reports machine issues
- Takes photos of completed work
- Follows production schedules

### How Security Works

**Token-based authentication**:
- Like temporary ID badges that expire
- Must be renewed periodically
- Different tokens give different access levels
- Lost tokens can be cancelled remotely

**Permission checking**:
- Every action checked against user role
- System blocks unauthorized actions
- All activities logged for audit trail
- Sensitive data encrypted

## Data Backup and Safety

### Automatic Backups

**Daily backups** ensure:
- All job information saved
- Customer data protected
- Inventory records preserved
- System settings backed up

**Think of it as**: Making photocopies of all important restaurant records every night.

### Redundancy and Recovery

**Multiple safety measures**:
- Database automatically saves changes
- System monitors itself for problems
- Backup servers ready to take over
- Recovery procedures tested regularly

**Like**: Having backup cooks, spare equipment, and emergency procedures ready.

## Performance and Scalability

### Handling Busy Periods

**System designed to handle**:
- Multiple users working simultaneously
- Heavy activity during busy times
- Large file uploads and downloads
- Complex database queries

**Like**: Restaurant kitchen designed to handle rush hour with multiple orders at once.

### Growing with the Business

**System can expand by**:
- Adding more server capacity
- Connecting additional machines
- Supporting more users
- Storing more historical data

**Like**: Restaurant that can add more tables, hire more staff, and expand the kitchen.

## Integration Points

### How Different Parts Connect

**Frontend (User Interface)**:
- Web browsers display information
- Tablets at machines for operators
- Mobile phones for notifications
- All connect to same central system

**Backend (Server and Database)**:
- Single source of truth for all data
- Handles all business logic
- Manages security and permissions
- Coordinates real-time updates

**External Systems**:
- Email for notifications
- File storage for job artwork
- Backup systems for data safety
- Monitoring tools for system health

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When the System Seems Slow

**Usually caused by**:
- Too many people using it at once
- Large files being uploaded
- Network connectivity issues
- Background maintenance tasks

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few minutes for activity to decrease
- Check internet connection
- Contact system administrator
- Try refreshing the browser

### When Information Doesn't Update

**Usually caused by**:
- Browser not connected to server
- Network interruption
- User doesn't have permission
- System temporary maintenance

**Solutions**:
- Refresh the browser page
- Check network connection
- Log out and log back in
- Contact technical support
