# Project Overview

## What is the Manufacturing Operations Management System?

The Manufacturing Operations Management System is a digital solution designed specifically for **Ganpathi Overseas**, a printing business. Think of it as the "brain" that helps manage and coordinate all printing operations from when an order comes in until it's completed and delivered.

## 🎯 What Problem Does It Solve?

Before this system, managing a printing business involved:

- **Paper tracking** - Keeping track of different paper types, sizes, and quantities manually
- **Job management** - Using paper forms or spreadsheets to track print jobs
- **Machine coordination** - Manually assigning jobs to printing machines
- **Cost calculation** - Calculating costs by hand for each job
- **Status updates** - Walking around to check job progress
- **Customer management** - Maintaining customer information in files or basic spreadsheets

This system **automates and digitizes** all these processes, making the business more efficient and reducing errors.

## 🏭 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Imagine the system as a **smart factory manager** that:

1. **Receives Orders**: When a customer wants something printed, the details are entered into the system
2. **Checks Materials**: The system checks if you have enough paper and materials
3. **Calculates Costs**: Automatically figures out how much the job will cost
4. **Assigns Work**: Decides which printing machine should do the job
5. **Tracks Progress**: Monitors the job as it moves through different stages
6. **Updates Everyone**: Keeps all staff informed about job status in real-time
7. **Manages Inventory**: Tracks paper usage and alerts when supplies are low
